## ChangeLog

**Winter Break 2022**
Continued developing long autonomous utilizing sensors.
Developed short autonomous, again utilizing new sensors.
Added comments to nearly every single line of code to ensure no one is confused.



**12/5/22**
Developed Auton. Skills
Strengthend Spinner Axil
All motor temperatures are display'ed on brain.
Helped upper school recover after their wonderful tournament (both morally and with genuine engineering)


**12/4/22**
Added Battery Temperature status to controller along with warnings utilizing Lists: append/remove
Begun thinking of ways to utilize 2 distance sensors along with a color sensor in order to detect where net is.

**12/3/22**
Day of tournament;
Won 2 Awards: Excellence and Finalists
Changed ShooterGroup system to utilize +10, -10, +5 buttons all on controller


**12/2/22**
Autonomous Mode Works
Shooter has been updated to high functionality and success rate
Gyroscope Added

**12/1/22**
Continued working on Autonomous Mode (long)
Developed Timer along with automatic deployment of Horizontal Expansion if driver forgets to activate Numatic's at 3'.
Added rails at the top of intake to allow for more guideness when disks travel up.

**11/30/22**
Worked on Autonomous Mode (long)
Completed testing for moving axis on intake.
Created haptics and additional status info utilizing a GUI.

**11/29/22**
Fixed Pusher Bugs
Worked on Autonomous Mode
Updated Status on Screen
Completed moving axis for Intake

**11/28/22** 
Changed intake to Red Gears to increase friction and minimize slack... Gear cannot enter nor exit the intake due to the lack of entry space.
Added SHooter Velocity Status to Controller

## IDE:
We will be utilizing a VScode VEX extension that will allow us to transfer from the incredibly bliding and traumatizing IDE of Vex (which refuses to add a dark theme) and switching to Visual Studio Code. This transfer will also allow us to work with .py files as opposed to .python5 files:
**Please Refer to the Following Steps**
**Ensure [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is installed locally.**
**Ensure you are on atleast Python Version 3.10.** To check: MAC: Open Terminal, Type "python --version" OR "python3 --version" Windows: Open CMD and type "python --version"
**Install the [VexCode Extension](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode/vscode-extension?___store=vexroboticseu&___from_store=vexrobotics#:~:text=The%20VEX%20VS%20Code%20extension,that%20they%20may%20find%20useful.):** Refer to the website for more info.
**Import the Project Using the Extension on VSCode (ON SideBar)**
